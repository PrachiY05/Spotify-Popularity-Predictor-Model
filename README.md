# Spotify-Popularity-Predictor-Model
## Project Overview
In the vast ocean of tracks available on Spotify, some songs become instant hits, while others don't gain as much traction. Why do certain tracks resonate more with the global audience? With Spotify's track-level attributes dataset, there's an opportunity to decode the anatomy of a popular track. By analyzing attributes like danceability, tempo, and valence, we aim to uncover patterns and possibly predict the next big hit.

## Goal of the Project
Understand the underlying characteristics of popular tracks.
Develop a predictive model to determine track popularity based on its attributes.

## Business Objectives
To derive actionable insights from Spotify's track-level attributes dataset, with the aim of understanding the defining characteristics of popular tracks. These insights will be used to guide artists, music producers, and record labels in optimizing their music production and promotion strategies.

In simpler terms: Uncover what makes a track popular on Spotify and use this knowledge to create and promote music that resonates with a global audience.

## Methodology
## Descriptive Analysis
Gain a foundational understanding of the dataset by summarizing key attributes for each track.
Describe the distribution of track popularity and play counts.
## Correlational Study
Identify which track attributes have the strongest correlation with popularity or play count.
## Trend Analysis
Examine if there's a trend in the attributes of top tracks over the years.
## Album Impact
Determine if tracks from certain albums tend to be more popular than others.
## Predictive Modeling
Develop a model using machine learning techniques to predict track popularity based on its attributes.
## Recommendations
Offer insights on track attributes that make songs more popular on Spotify.
Provide feedback to artists and producers on potential track modifications.
## Future Predictions
Forecast the attributes of tracks that might become hits in the upcoming years based on current trends and the predictive model.

## Features
Data Extraction: Extracted data from Spotify's Web API using Python.
Data Modeling: Trained predictive models using various machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.
Evaluation: Employed K-Fold Cross Validation for model evaluation.
